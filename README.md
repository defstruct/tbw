Simple Template Based Web for Clojure.

## Comment
This is my first Clojure project. Any suggestion will be welcomed.

## Idea
Define a site using declarative style.
Web pages of the same website usually has the same style and to acheive this just use template html files.
A website is defined by a unique uri prefix.

## Usage

FIXME: write
